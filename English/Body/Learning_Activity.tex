        This module carries a weight of 18 credits, indicating that a
        student should spend an average of 180 hours to master the
        required skills (including time spent preparing for tests and
        examinations). This means that you should devote an average of
        13 hours of study time per week to this module. The scheduled
        contact time is approximately seven hours per week, which
        means that another six hours per week of own study time
        should be devoted to the module.

            \label{tab:lectures}
        \end{table}

        Lecture attendance and participation in discussions are compulsory.
        Since the contents of each lecture follow on those of previous lectures,
        it is in the students’ own interest to study the material covered on a regular
        basis and not to miss a lecture. However, should a student not be able to
        attend a certain lecture for whatever reason, the onus is on him / her to
        obtain the study material and catch up on the work. No individual lectures
        will be presented. Previous material will rarely be repeated in a following
        lecture.

        Students are expected to prepare for lectures. Since a large volume of work
        needs to be covered, it is not possible to lecture every aspect in the
        finest detail. Students should therefore read the textbooks thoroughly
        and already know beforehand what the next lecture is about in order to
        identify anything that is unclear. The lecturer may also assign some
        sections of the study notes and lecture notes / handouts for self-study.
        These sections will be part of the syllabus, but will not be discussed
        in the class.

        Dr Wilke will present the \textbf{Afrikaans} lectures and Mr
        Page the \textbf{English} lectures as shown in
        Table~\ref{tab:lectures}. The lectures are split as per the
        time table above. Please refer to {\it ClickUP} for any time table
        updates.

            \end{center}
            \label{tab:tutorials}
        \end{table}

        Tutorial sessions will be used to further develop the students
        understanding and knowledge of the topics covered in lectures
        by solving numerous engineering and mathematical problems with
        the tools introduced in this module. The tutorial sessions are
        tabulated in Table~\ref{tab:tutorials}, and allocated
        according to discipline (S - Civil, C - Chemical, m - Mining,
        M - Mechanical etc.)

        Each week's tutorial session will be used to review the
        previous week's lecture content and concepts. Selected
        exercise problems, from the study notes, will be covered
        during the tutorial sessions. The selected chapters and
        problems, that will be covered in each tutorial session, will
        be added to {\it ClickUP}.

        It is vital that students do these tutorial problems on their
        own, prior to attending the tutorial session, and use the
        tutorial session for getting help with problems and / or
        concepts that the student is struggling with. It is important
        to understand that the tutors are there to assist the student
        to grasp difficult concepts that limits a student to solve a
        problem and not to solve the problems on their behalf.

        \textbf{Attendance} of the \textbf{tutorial sessions}
        are \textbf{optional} but \textbf{handing in} of the
        \textbf{tutorial assignments} on \textbf{{\it ClickUP}
          compulsory}, as they will be \textbf{graded and count
          towards the semester mark}.}
        %Tutorial session attendance and participation in discussions
        %are compulsory.XXX NOT ENOUGH SPACE TO ACCOMMODATE EVERYONE!
        % HANDING IN OF ASSIGNMENTS IS COMPULSORY. TUTORIAL HELP STUDENTS.
        
        Since the contents of each tutorial session follows on those
        of previous tutorial session, it is in the students’ own
        interest to study the material covered on a regular basis and
        not to miss a tutorial session.

        It will be to the benefit of the student to complete these
        problems as solving these problems will develop the students
        thinking and programming ability as the tests and exam will
        test the ability of the student to solve new problems of
        similar complexity.

        Students may also make use of the discussion board on {\it
          ClickUP} should you have a specific question regarding a
        given tutorial problem and / or concept.

        \textbf{Note:} Tutorial assignments must be solved and
        programmed independently. All electronically submitted
        material is easily checked for plagiarism, which will not be
        tolerated. Refer to the Departmental Study Guide (see section
        \ref{sec:dep_study_guide}) for more information on plagiarism.
