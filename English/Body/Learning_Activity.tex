        This module carries a weight of 18 credits, indicating that a student
        should spend an average of 180 hours to master the required skills
        (including time spent preparing for tests and examinations). This means
        that you should devote an average of 12 hours of study time per week to
        this module. The scheduled contact time is approximately seven hours
        per week, which means that another five hours per week of own study
        time should be devoted to the module.

             \caption{Lecture Time Table}
            \end{center}
        \end{table}

        Lecture attendance and participation in discussions are compulsory.
        Since the contents of each lecture follow on those of previous lectures,
        it is in the students’ own interest to study the material covered on a regular
        basis and not to miss a lecture. However, should a student not be able to
        attend a certain lecture for whatever reason, the onus is on him / her to
        obtain the study material and catch up on the work. No individual lectures
        will be presented. Previous material will rarely be repeated in a following
        lecture.

        Students are expected to prepare for lectures. Since a large volume of work
        needs to be covered, it is not possible to lecture every aspect in the
        finest detail. Students should therefore read the textbooks thoroughly
        and already know beforehand what the next lecture is about in order to
        identify anything that is unclear. The lecturer may also assign some
        sections of the study notes and lecture notes / handouts for self-study.
        These sections will be part of the syllabus, but will not be discussed
        in the class.

        Dr Wilke will present the lectures in Afrikaans and Mr Page will present
        the lectures in English (according to the time table shown above). The
        lectures are split as per the time table above. Please refer to Click-Up
        for any time table updates.

    \subsection{Homework Problems}
        The lecturer may provide analytical problems to enhance the students’
        independent skills to formulate the problem physics and analyse the
        applications of the theory. Students should work out the problems in
        their own time. The problems do not have to be submitted as they will
        not be evaluated. No solutions will be provided for these homework
        problems.

        It will be to the benefit of the student to complete these problems as
        similar forms of the problems may be asked in the tests or exam.
        You may make use of the discussion board on Click-UP should you have a
        specific question regarding a given homework problem.

        \end{table}

        Tutorial sessions will be used to further develop the students
        understanding and knowledge of the topics covered in lectures by
        solving numerous engineering and mathematical problems with the
        tools introduced in this module.

        Tutorial session attendance and participation in discussions are
        compulsory. Since the contents of each tutorial session follows on
        those of previous tutorial session, it is in the students’ own
        interest to study the material covered on a regular basis and not
        to miss a tutorial session.
