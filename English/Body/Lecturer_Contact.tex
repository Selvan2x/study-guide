    \subsection{Teaching Assistants}
        The contact details and consulting hours for the teaching assistants will
        be added to Click-UP as soon as the teaching assistants have been 
        allocated.
    
    \subsection{Consulting Hours}
        Consultation hours of the lecturers and teaching assistants will be 
        announced at the start of the semester. These hours will also be 
        displayed on their office doors and on Click-Up. These hours indicate
        when the lecturers and teaching assistants are on campus and available
        for consultation. Students are requested to please make an appointment
        so as to ensure that the lecturers and teaching assistants are in their
        offices. 
        
        Students are welcome to make special arrangements to see the lecturers at
        times outside of their consulting hours if it is necessary. It is important
        not to wait until just before a test or exam to clarify any problems. 
        There will be no extraordinary consulting hours during test and exam time.
        
        Students are also welcome to make use of the discussion board on the new 
        Click-UP system. This will allow lecturers, teaching assistants and fellow
        students to answer any queries regarding programming concepts,
        exercise problems, etc. during their free time.
