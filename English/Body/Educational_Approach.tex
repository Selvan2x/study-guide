\section{Educational Approach}
    Programming knowledge and skills are important for engineers. Complex
    calculations and analysis that would take days if done by hand can take
    only seconds with a well structured program. It is for this reason that
    engineers obtain at least some proficiency in programming.

    The general objectives of this module are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item To enable the students to solve engineering problems by
            developing, debugging, and running basic computer programs.
        \item To enable the students to process computer data and output
            (text and visual) information or knowledge.
    \end{itemize}

    Elementary mathematical concepts, which the students should
    already be familiar with, will be used to illustrate basic
    computer logic and programming principles. The student will be
    required to 'translate' mathematical formulas and/or principles
    into a working computer program in order to solve some problems.

    The educational approach is problem driven, in other words
    programming skills are acquired by solving problems. The mastering
    of tutorial and homework problems is therefore essential to be successful
    in this module.

    Student-orientated and cooperative study methods will be applied during
    the lectures and tutorial sessions in order to establish the core concepts
    of the course. Students are expected to participate in discussions in
    class since this creates an opportunity to share experiences and solve
    problems in a team orientated environment. This will mimic what generally
    occurs in industry. Problem solving sessions during lectures will provide
    students with opportunities to assimilate and understand difficult concepts.

    \subsection{Departmental Study Guide} \label{sec:dep_study_guide}
        This study guide is a crucial part of the general Departmental study guide.
        In the Departmental study guide, information is given
        on the mission and vision of the Department, general administration and
        regulations (professionalism and integrity, course related information
        and formal communication, workshop use and safety, plagiarism, class
        representative duties, sick test and sick exam guidelines, vacation
        work, university regulations, frequently asked questions), ECSA
        outcomes and ECSA exit level outcomes, ECSA knowledge area, CDIO,
        new curriculum and assessment of cognitive levels. It is expected that
        you are very familiar with the content of the Departmental Study Guide.
        It is available in English and Afrikaans on the
